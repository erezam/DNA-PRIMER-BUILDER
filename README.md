# Introduction

This project is a software for building primers to DNA genetic testing in a PCR machine. </br>
What is a primer?</br>
Primeris a short section of nucleic acid that assists in DNA replication.</br>
The reason for its existence is the inability of the DNA polymerase enzyme to begin creating a new strand of DNA, The enzyme, responsible for cell DNA replication, is able to exclusively extend an existing DNA strand. </br>
Primer gives the enzyme a starting point for creating a new strand.</br>
Primers are artificially manufactured by biotech companies and are widely used in genetics and molecular biology, such as PCR.</br>
PCR is a laboratory method used to rapidly replicate DNA fragments.</br>
It is customary to use PCR to scan for genetic diseases and to perform comparative analysis of DNA from different populations, including DNA from extinct species. </br>
The method is essential for deciphering crimes and establishing paternity.</br>
The principle of operation of the instrument consists of 3 stages in each cycle: denaturation, annealing of primers suitable for the edges of the segment to be duplicated and elongation via a heat-resistant DNA polymerase called Taq DNA polymerase.The device repeats these steps of the multiplication cycle, several dozen times (usually 25-30), until the desired amplification of the segment.</br>
The software built in the project will build a primer (13-28 characters long) according to the requirements to search for a specific gene in a PCR machine.</br>
The software will work in the form of automatic attenuation of the constraints and produce the highest-priority primer without human interference.</br>
The software will be built as a publicly available network application and will use existing databases for the necessary data on DNA.</br>

 # About Us
 
 We are two students of Software Engineering at Azrieli - Jerusalem College of Engineering. This project is our final project to get our B.Sc degree. We are implementing a Website to be used by researchers in the field of medicine and biotechnology. The site will be used to create a primer for gene testing in a PCR machine. The resulting PRIMER will meet stringent requirements and will be an optimal primer that does not contain mutations.
